# Accesible sound based visuals in the browser

Audio based visuals created for Hertzian Space event in Helsinki, Finland as a part of experimental project. Visuals consist of the  computer microphone sound visual representation, number of simple geometrial patterns  which creates illusion of movement when rotation happening. User allowed to change the type, size and rotation speed of patterns as well as depth of live sound analysis.    

## Online link 

This [LINK](https://secure-atoll-60330.herokuapp.com/)  will get you a  working copy without any installation accessible through Google Chrome (others browsers haven't been tested, MACbooks work very badly). You need to give access to your mic in order to analyse the sound and for creation visuals. The sound isn't used for any other purpose.  Also copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes is avaliable using this Github repository and  Nodejs running server.js file.  



### Controllers

Dont forget to go into fullscreen mode and reload the page! 

* Q - turn off autopilot (do this if you want to access manual control mode, its turned on at the beggining)
* Keys 1 to 0 change visual patterns in the middle of the screen ( Key 0 is a webcam)
* Key - (minus, next key to the right after 0 ) removes pattern from the screen
* Left and Right arrows continiusly increase acceleration of rotation of the pattern
* Space - stop any kind of acceleration
* UP and DOWN keys increase/decrease size of the pattern
* A - turn on autopilot (control only speed of rotation)
* X - stop rotation in manual mod

Depth of the microphone based visuals can be controlled by increasing or decreasing sensitivity of mic using standard Windows or IOS  recording device control panel.
